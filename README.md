Unified Modeling and Automated Scheduling for Manufacturing as a Service (UniMaaS) delivers a platform enabling flexible, decentralized manufacturing and supply chains as a Service for European SMEs and industries. The project addresses key challenges including product customization, circularity and sustainability, minimal downtime, predictive maintenance, seamless communication, robustness to demand/resource variability, and cost/performance optimization.

## Platform Overview

UniMaaS comprises three integrated suites that work together across the manufacturing lifecycle:

- Data Modelling Suite: manufacturing dataspaces, cloud-based resource monitoring, trusted cross-company data exchange, and digital product passport.
- Modelling Suite: modular modeling of manufacturing resources, intent-based servitization, AI-based estimations, and Zero‑X analysis.
- Decision‑Making Suite: scheduling and planning of resources, with circularity and sustainability optimization.

Powered by cloud computing, digital twins, and trustworthy AI, the UniMaaS platform provides easy access to customized manufacturing service chains and supports end‑to‑end lifecycle management of processes and products.

## Pilots

The platform and suites will be demonstrated in four pilots:

- Aircraft maintenance
- Automotive seating
- 3D construction printing
- Logistics and warehouse management
