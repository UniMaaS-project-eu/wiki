## IC15 - Cloud Mfg Orchestrator

**Component metadata:** **ID:** IC15 | **Name:** Cloud Mfg Orchestrator | **Area:** Decision-Making | **Partner:** NTUA | **Task:** T6.3 | **TRL:** TBD

The sections below are suggested to keep component documentation consistent across UniMaaS. If another structure better describes this component, partners may adapt it, as long as the page clearly explains the component role, integrations, API documentation, architecture, data models, and deployment information.

## Description of Component

Coordinates platform workflows and virtualized resources using cloud-native technologies, such as container orchestration and workflow execution engines, to execute requests and integrate with external ERP systems. Moreover, the Cloud Manufacturing Orchestrator coordinates the platform workflows for all the UniMaaS functionalities based on triggering events through the UniMaaS dashboard or any other component across the UniMaaS suites.

## Integration Context

Describe how the component connects with the rest of the platform.

Suggested points:

- Input dependencies from other components.
- Output dependencies to other components.
- Communication protocols and interfaces.
- Main exchanged data, events, files, or API calls.

## OpenAPI Specs / API Documentation

Where applicable, provide:

- Repository OpenAPI spec: TBD
- Swagger UI: TBD

Recommended approach:

- Keep `docs/openapi.yaml` in the component repository.
- Copy `docs/index.html` from `UniMaaS-project-eu/openapi-swagger-pages-template`.
- Enable GitHub Pages from `main` branch, `/docs` folder.

If the component does not expose an API, state that clearly.

## Architecture of the Component

Describe the internal architecture of the component.

Suggested points:

- Main services/modules.
- Architecture mapping to the UniMaaS platform.
- External systems used.
- Diagram, if available.

## Data Models

Describe the main data structures handled by the component.

Suggested points:

- Request/response models.
- RDF/ontology terms.
- Database entities.
- Event/message payloads.
- Files, schemas, or exchanged datasets.

## Deployment Notes

Describe how the component is built, configured, deployed, and operated.

Suggested points:

- Existing codebase/repository link.
- Programming languages and frameworks.
- Dockerized: Yes/No.
- State if a Dockerfile, Docker Compose, Helm, Kubernetes, or other deployment asset exists.
- Environment dependencies, containers, systems, databases, queues, or external services.
- Required environment variables or configuration files.
- Minimum hardware/runtime requirements, if relevant.

## Other

Add notes, comments, references, known limitations, open questions, or contact details.
