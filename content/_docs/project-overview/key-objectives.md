## Key Objectives and Innovation Areas

UniMaaS focuses on five primary innovation areas:

1. **On-the-fly Modeling**: Dynamic creation and adaptation of models describing manufacturing supply chains as hybrid systems
2. **AI-based Servitization**: Intent-based mechanisms that translate natural language requests into precise manufacturing specifications
3. **Interoperable Data Spaces**: Secure, trusted cross-company data exchange using Manufacturing Data Spaces and Knowledge Graphs
4. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Real-time resource scheduling, planning, and optimization with sustainability considerations
5. **Digital Twins**: AI-assisted simulation and visualization of manufacturing resources for performance assessment

The platform adopts advanced digital technologies including cloud computing, digital twins, and trustworthy AI to fulfill these objectives.
