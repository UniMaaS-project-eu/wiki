## Aircraft Maintenance as a Service

## Use Case Description

Led by **AEGEAN Airlines** in collaboration with NTUA and QUB, this pilot addresses workload optimization and scheduling challenges in aircraft maintenance operations.

## Challenge

Aircraft maintenance involves complex scheduling of both planned and unscheduled maintenance tasks. Unexpected maintenance requirements can disrupt carefully planned schedules, leading to inefficiencies and increased downtime for aviation fleets.

## UniMaaS Solution

The pilot establishes design, development, and implementation guidelines to tackle challenges posed by unscheduled maintenance tasks and enhance overall efficiency of maintenance project scheduling. The platform will:

- Optimize resource allocation for maintenance activities
- Enable dynamic rescheduling in response to unscheduled maintenance needs
- Improve coordination across maintenance service providers
- Reduce aircraft downtime through predictive maintenance approaches

## Expected Impact

Validation of WP4, WP5, and WP6 outputs against aviation industry requirements, demonstrating practical applicability and efficacy of the UniMaaS platform in the demanding aerospace maintenance context.
