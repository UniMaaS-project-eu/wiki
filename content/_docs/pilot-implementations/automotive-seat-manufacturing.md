## Automotive Seat Manufacturing

## Use Case Description

Led by **ADIENT** in partnership with UPV and QUB, this pilot focuses on sustainable supply chain production and transport planning in the automotive seating manufacturing sector.

## Challenge

Automotive seating manufacturing involves complex, dynamic supply chain processes with multiple suppliers, manufacturing facilities, and just-in-time delivery requirements. Optimizing this network for both performance and sustainability presents significant challenges.

## UniMaaS Solution

The pilot identifies requirements and specifications to address sustainable supply chain production and transport planning. Key implementation areas include:

- Dynamic supply chain optimization considering sustainability metrics
- Real-time coordination between suppliers and manufacturing sites
- Transport planning optimization to reduce environmental impact
- Adaptive manufacturing scheduling based on demand fluctuations

## Expected Impact

Enhanced overall performance of automotive supply chains through improved efficiency, reduced waste, and better resource utilization. The pilot validates UniMaaS platform capabilities in handling complex multi-tier supply chain scenarios typical of the automotive industry.
