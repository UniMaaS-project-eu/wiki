## Logistics and Warehouse Management

## Use Case Description

Led by **CATONE** in partnership with NTUA and QUB, this pilot focuses on automated warehouse system management based on AI technologies for temperature-controlled logistics.

## Company Profile

Catone Group specializes in supply chain management with a focus on distribution of temperature-controlled goods (e.g., food products). The company operates a fleet of over 200 refrigerated vehicles equipped with thermo-recorders and satellite-based security control to ensure HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) compliance.

## Pilot Activities

1. **Requirements Specification**: Definition of system requirements including fundamental indicators to be monitored and controlled
2. **System Integration**: Deployment of specific equipment and tools to ensure integration of UniMaaS platform with CATONE legacy systems
3. **Execution and Validation**: Use case execution with validation of specified indicators and feedback provision for system fine-tuning

## Human-Centric Approach

A key aspect of this pilot is the **human-in-the-loop** concept, ensuring workforce well-being has equal priority with performance metrics (cost and time), addressing all three dimensions of sustainability: economic, environmental, and societal.

## Expected Impact

The pilot validates WP4, WP5, and WP6 outputs against logistics requirements, demonstrating practical applicability of the UniMaaS platform in the critical supply chain and warehouse management sector, with particular emphasis on temperature-sensitive goods management.
