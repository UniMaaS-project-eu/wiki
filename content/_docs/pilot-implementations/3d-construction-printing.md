## 3D Construction Printing

## Use Case Description

Led by **ANV** in collaboration with LUK, this pilot explores flexibility and closed-loop economy in on-demand manufacturing using 3D printing technology for civil engineering and housing construction.

## Challenge

Traditional construction methods struggle with customization, waste generation, and adapting to specific customer preferences. Large-scale 3D printing offers opportunities for customization but requires sophisticated planning and material management.

## UniMaaS Solution

The pilot establishes design, development, and implementation guidelines for:

- Custom, large-scale component production for construction applications
- Rapid production reconfiguration for customized goods according to customer preferences
- Dynamic optimization of product creation and assembly for efficiency
- Circular economy principles through material reuse and waste minimization
- Data tracking throughout the product lifecycle via Digital Product Passports

## Innovation

The platform enables customers to submit online orders for customized construction components. UniMaaS then translates design intents into manufacturing specifications, routes orders to appropriate 3D printing facilities based on workload, material availability, and location, and provides data-driven recommendations for component recycling, reusability, and refurbishment.[1]

## Expected Impact

Validation of additive manufacturing requirements, demonstrating 10% reduction in energy consumption, 10% decrease in waste of resources and materials, and 15% overall efficiency improvements through rapid production reconfiguration.
